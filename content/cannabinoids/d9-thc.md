# Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC)

## Identity

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Preferred name | Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) |
| IUPAC name | (6aR,10aR)-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[c]chromen-1-ol |
| CAS number | 1972-08-3 |
| PubChem CID | 16078 |
| InChIKey | CYQFCXCEBYINGO-IAGOWGBFSA-N [^1] |
| Molecular formula | C21H30O2 |
| Molecular mass | 314.46 g/mol (exact 314.2246 Da) |
| Compound class | Phytocannabinoid; neutral (non-acidic) cannabinoid |
| Stereochemistry | Natural material is (−)-trans-(6aR,10aR). Δ8-THC (CAS 5957-75-5) is a distinct positional isomer; never collapse the two in reporting [^1] |
| Major synonyms | THC, Δ9-THC, dronabinol (INN); decarboxylation product of THCA |

### Identity notes

- Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC are distinct positional isomers with distinct CAS numbers (1972-08-3 vs. 5957-75-5) and must not be collapsed [^1].
- The neutral compound is the decarboxylation product of THCA; GC without derivatization converts THCA to THC in the injector, so "Total THC" figures mix measured and converted material [^2].
- THCV (C19, propyl side chain) and THC (C21, pentyl side chain) are distinct homologues [^1].

## Physical properties

| Property | Value | Conditions / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boiling point | Predicted normal boiling temperature ≈417 °C (690.4 K) at 1 atm; extrapolated from vapor-pressure data, not an observed phase change | Direct vapor-pressure measurements covered ≈25–121 °C; decomposition prevents a direct atmospheric boiling observation [^3][^10] |
| Vapor pressure | Measured ≈2.6×10⁻⁵ Pa at 25 °C to ≈0.22 Pa at 121 °C | Lovestead & Bruno 2017, direct measurement [^3] |
| Melting point | No sharp melting point; viscous oil/semi-solid at room temperature | |
| logP (octanol-water) | ≈5.7 (reported) | Highly lipophilic |
| Water solubility | Practically insoluble | Soluble in ethanol, methanol, chloroform, oils, CO₂ |
| Thermal decomposition | In the cited GC-injector study, Δ9-THC loss reached 17.2% at the study's 300 °C inlet condition and CBN increased; no universal decomposition threshold is assigned | Injector temperature and residence time are study conditions, not a device sample temperature [^4] |
| Oxidation / light sensitivity | Oxidation is condition-dependent; CBN formation is reported under prolonged air/heat exposure [^4] | Store opaque, inert |
| Known degradation products | Cannabinol (CBN, oxidation), Δ8-THC (isomerization), quinones (pyrolysis) | [^4][^5] |

> **Boiling point is not a device setpoint.** The commonly repeated ≈155–157 °C figure is associated with low-pressure vaporization or a device setting, not an atmospheric boiling observation. The predicted thermodynamic boiling point of pure Δ9-THC is ≈417 °C at 1 atm, while device chamber temperature is not sample temperature and material in plant matrix lags the setpoint [^3][^10].

## Thermal-extraction context

{{include includes/boiling-point-vs-device-note.md}}

THC is the neutral product of THCA decarboxylation; conversion is temperature-, time-, atmosphere-, and matrix-dependent, so no universal onset is assigned here [^2]. It is released from botanical matrix by vapor-pressure-driven evaporation. Because vapor pressures are measured only below ≈121 °C, the evaporation rate at common device operating temperatures is an extrapolation, not a measurement; device setpoint and sample temperature are distinct [^3]. The thermodynamic boiling point of the pure compound is not a device setpoint or a sample temperature.

## Cannabis occurrence

- The principal intoxicating constituent of drug-type cannabis; measured drug-type flower batches in legal-market COA datasets report Δ9-THC (and THCA) across a wide batch-to-batch range [^6].
- Values are batch- and report-attached; no universal cultivar claim is made. Consult [Lab Results](../lab-results.md) for batch-level measurements.

## Biosynthesis and processing

Δ9-THC is biosynthesized as THCA (by THCAS from the shared CBGA pool) and converted to the neutral compound by decarboxylation during drying, curing, and heating [^2][^7]. Prolonged oxidation converts THC to CBN [^4].

## Reported biological activity

### Human evidence
Δ9-THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis; its acute effects are mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, established in controlled human pharmacology [^8][^9]. This archive does not assess therapeutic efficacy or public-health policy.

### Preclinical animal and in vitro evidence

{{include includes/preclinical-evidence-note.md}}

CB1/CB2 receptor pharmacology is well characterized in vitro [^9]; behavioral and physiological effects in animals do not by themselves establish human outcomes.

### Industry claims
Device marketing that equates a single "boiling point" with a recommended temperature setpoint, or that implies boiling-point tables determine extraction efficiency, is not supported by the measured vapor-pressure data [^3][^10].

## Degradation products

- Primary: CBN (oxidation), Δ8-THC (isomerization), quinones (pyrolysis) [^4][^5]
