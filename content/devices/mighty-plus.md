# Storz & Bickel Mighty+ (TED-0003)

{{include includes/manufacturer-claim-note.md}}

## Technical Specifications

| Property | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Manufacturer | [Storz & Bickel GmbH](../manufacturers/storz-bickel.md) |
| Part Number | `01 01 MY` (Storz & Bickel article number, MIGHTY+ product page) [^3] |
| Form Factor | Handheld portable vaporizer with a fixed cooling-unit mouthpiece (direct-draw); not a desktop unit [^3] |
| Release Year | 2021 [^1] |
| Heating Method | Hybrid conduction and convection: Storz & Bickel states all of its devices use "a patented combination of hot air convection and additional conduction heating," with the Filling Chamber itself heated in addition to the pre-heated air stream [^8] |
| Heat Generation | Electric resistance heater inside the ceramic-coated aluminum Filling Chamber; the manufacturer does not publish the specific element sub-type (rod, coil, or cartridge), so the general `resistive` value is used here rather than a more specific one [^3][^8] |
| Operation Mode | Session |
| Temperature Range | 40 °C – 210 °C (104 °F – 410 °F), adjustable [^2] |
| Temperature Control | Digital OLED display (set-point control) |
| Chamber Volume | 1.4 cm³ (per manufacturer); ≈0.25 g raw flower is a third-party estimate, not an official figure [^3] |
| Chamber Surface | Ceramic-coated aluminum |
| Cooling Unit / Airpath | PEEK cooling unit with a labyrinth-designed airpath (per manufacturer) [^4] |
| Power Source | Two internal lithium-ion cells, 3300 mAh total (per manufacturer); "18650" cell format is reported by third parties, not stated officially [^5] |
| Charging | USB-C with Power Delivery (5–15 V), max. power consumption ≈45 W; complies with IEC 60335 and EN 55011 (consumer electrical safety and EMC; distinct from the medical-device certification below); "Supercharge" reaches ~80 % in ~40 minutes; rated operating temperature 5 °C–35 °C (41 °F–95 °F) [^5]. Pass-through operation is supported with a sufficiently powerful USB-C supply (≥15 V @ 3 A): the batteries are bridged and the display shows "dct" to confirm pass-through charging, but the unit does not run directly on mains power without its batteries fitted — this archive does not tag `mains` alongside `battery` for that reason [^5] |
| Heat-Up Time | ≈60–70 seconds to 180 °C (per manufacturer) [^2] |
| Compatible Media | Dry botanical flower; concentrates via stainless steel pad |

## Medical Device Status & Certification

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the **Mighty+ MEDIC** (and Volcano MEDIC 2) are certified medical devices, certified under the European Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) by TÜV SÜD in July 2023 [^6]. The consumer **Mighty+** sold to the public is **not** a certified medical device; household units are subject to consumer appliance safety standards. Terms such as "medical grade" for materials are manufacturer marketing language unless a specific material standard is cited [^7].

## Safety Notes

- Official pre-use guidance: confirm vapors from cleaning agents or disinfectants have fully evaporated before turning the device on; do not block or cover the air vents during use or cooling down; inspect the vaporizer and power supply for visible damage before use; confirm the voltage on the rating plate matches the local power supply; fully charge the device before first use; do not leave it unattended during operation, and unplug the power adapter immediately if a malfunction occurs [^9].
- The device carries two internal lithium-ion cells (3300 mAh total); allow it to cool completely before storage, and use only the original Storz & Bickel charger to avoid damage or voiding the warranty [^5][^9].
- See also "Medical Device Status & Certification" below for the consumer-vs-medical certification distinction.

## Cleaning & Maintenance Protocol

1. **Disassembly**: Separate cooling unit top piece, mouth piece, screen, and sealing rings.
2. **Soaking**: Submerge non-electronic cooling unit components in >90% isopropyl alcohol for up to 30 minutes.
3. **Reassembly**: Rinse thoroughly with clean warm water, air dry completely, and inspect silicone o-rings prior to operation.

## Accessories & Consumables

- Stainless Steel Dosing Capsules
- Replacement PEEK Cooling Units
