This is the current coordination snapshot. It is intentionally shorter-lived
than docs/roadmap.md and more operational than the public changelog.

## Status vocabulary

- **Complete** — acceptance criteria met and verified.
- **In progress** — active implementation exists, but required work remains.
- **Blocked** — work cannot proceed until the named dependency is resolved.
- **Parked** — intentionally deferred.
- **Ready** — scoped and unblocked for an agent.

## Current workstream matrix

| Workstream | Status | Current evidence | Main blocker | Next deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap and coordination | Complete | docs/roadmap.md, this file, and state lanes exist | None | Keep status current as work lands |
| Multi-state ingestion architecture | In progress | California scripts and shared Massachusetts package coexist; Boris validates canonical page-ID shape/uniqueness while TED owns domain allocation and migration policy | One documented TED allocation boundary across the shared content map and state natural-key maps | Consolidate or explicitly scope the two TED ID maps |
| California DCC program | In progress | DCC scripts and content collections are on main; the bulk `data/dcc` payloads were removed from the tree and purged from git history on 2026-08-12, leaving only `manifest.json`, `schema-report.md` and one sync report tracked | Whether California is re-fetched through the shared adapter or documented as a frozen legacy snapshot | Reconcile or explicitly document the legacy path |
| Massachusetts CCC program | Complete | Live sync verified (15 datasets, ~954k rows); 118 source-backed pages published; IDs reconciled with the shared collections (Massachusetts = jurisdictions/TJUR-0022) | None. Massachusetts contributes zero audit findings and always did | Keep manifests current as CCC publishes |
| Michigan CRA program | In progress | The Michigan evidence wave merged in PR #31 as jurisdictions/TJUR-0023: 26 Michigan records plus two collection index pages updated, covering TLIC-0031..0033, TORG-0063..0068, TSTL-0029..0031, TDTS-0023..0027, TREQ-0003, TRCL-0007..0009, TPRD-0003..0005 and TCNT-0017. Lane document added 2026-08-13 | No adapter, no tests, no re-sync path: CRA sources are Accela search and DOCX aggregates, so Michigan evidence ages silently | Decide whether Michigan gets a document-source adapter or stays a curated wave — see docs/status/states/michigan.md |
| Device encyclopedia | In progress | Milestone A catalog now contains 100 devices and 29 manufacturers; Cannabis Hardware is fully classified (TCHG-0004). Recall coverage reached 16 records; RSS/Atom feeds and source-health auditing are present | Coverage of the remaining manufacturers | Apply the Cannabis Hardware completion pattern to the next manufacturer |
| Laboratory and batch/COA graph | Parked | California laboratory collections and demonstration records exist | Canonical batch/report/analyte model | Define the minimum batch/COA schema |
| Profile intelligence | Parked | Terpene and evidence reference pages exist | Measured batch corpus and normalization | Start after batch/COA model |
| Public release readiness | Blocked | Current audit (2026-10-02) reports 87 findings, 47 active: 32 `PII-005` low and 15 `REV-001` informational, with nothing at medium or above; prior 14 medium findings remain adjudicated | The purged licensee registry was reported anonymously downloadable through 43 pre-rewrite `refs/pull/N/head` refs; GitHub Support remediation remains unverified here | Confirm the stale pull refs are gone, then decide on licensee notification. Licence terms and the security contact remain open behind that |
| Static build reproducibility | Complete | **Historical baseline (2026-08-13):** two pinned builds produced 494 identical files, 10,149,589 bytes, aggregate SHA-256 `d19089d9…`; see `reports/static-build-reproducibility.md` | None | Run the monthly/manual reproducibility workflow and investigate any drift |

## Immediate priorities

1. Re-check and close the GitHub pull-ref exposure. The last verified state
   (2026-08-13) was that the licensee registry was downloadable without
   credentials from a public repository. Confirm whether the stale
   `refs/pull/*` refs still expose the objects, then ask GitHub Support to drop
   them if needed and decide whether the affected licensees need notifying.
   Nothing else on this list matters as much, and no local change can fix it.
2. Settle the licence terms and the security contact — the other two items
   between the repository and a public release decision.
3. Establish one safe multi-state ingestion contract without regressing
   California. Michigan is the forcing case: it is live content with no
   adapter, because its sources are documents rather than bulk datasets.
4. Make ID allocation global across all generated state collections.
5. Decide whether California is migrated into the shared adapter architecture
   or remains a documented legacy path.
6. Define the minimum product → batch → laboratory report → analyte model
   before scaling data ingestion.
7. Answer issue #34 — bounded versus native rendering for Boris relation slots.
   It gates whether the 174-line crosslink pagination layer can retire.

## Parallel-work contract

- The roadmap records direction and acceptance criteria; do not use it as a
  daily task log.
- Each state or workstream owns its file under docs/status/states/.
- Update the top-level status matrix only when a milestone, dependency, or
  status meaningfully changes.
- Changelog records are append-only and describe completed merged work or
  durable architectural decisions.
- Do not invent a parallel TCHG ID. Use an ID reserved here or ask the
  integrator to allocate one at merge time.
- Do not hand-edit metadata/id-map.jsonl. Run the approved ID tooling after
  content changes.
- Do not commit raw snapshots, build output, credentials, or local compiler
  binaries.
- `main` was rewritten and force-pushed on 2026-08-12. Any branch whose
  merge-base predates that rewrite reintroduces the purged `data/dcc` payloads if
  merged. Rebase it onto the current `origin/main`, or recreate the change, before
  opening a pull request.

## Changelog reservations

| ID | Reservation | Lane |
| --- | --- | --- |
| changelog/TCHG-0002 | Roadmap, status, and parallel-work coordination | This documentation PR |
| changelog/TCHG-0003 | Massachusetts CCC end-to-end integration | Massachusetts implementation agent |
| changelog/TCHG-0004 | Cannabis Hardware corpus completion | Merged — this lane |

Unused reservations may be released by the integrator; canonical IDs are
immutable once a record is merged.

## Known documentation state

The August 5 Massachusetts audit and implementation report are historical
snapshots. They contain useful design evidence, but their statements about
California being unreachable and Massachusetts work being uncommitted no
longer describe main. This status file is the current summary; stale
operational wording should be corrected as part of the relevant implementation
lane.

## Verification notes

Re-run 2026-10-02 against base commit `c7b8b72` and the issue-queue changes in
this worktree. `./bin/validate_graph.sh` passed: 546 content pages validated;
taxonomy, COA, and cannabinoid thermal audits reported no findings; record
completeness reported 24 non-blocking source-count warnings; 15 cultivar claims
validated against 546 entities; and crosslink validation reported 546 entities,
2,224 edges, and 1 COA record with no problems. Boris diagnostics and the HTML
ID audit passed.

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v` ran 421 tests with 6 skips and
no failures. `python3 scripts/test_ensure_boris.py -v` ran 4 tests with no
failures. The production build generated 546 sitemap URLs, 389 descriptions,
and 348 Cloudflare redirect rules. The large-file/history audit reported no
findings. The public-release audit reported 87 findings (47 active: 32 low
`PII-005` and 15 informational `REV-001`), with nothing at medium or above.

The 2026-08-13 reproducibility measurement above is historical and has not been
re-run against the current Boris pin or corpus.

## Archive integrity update

Verified 2026-08-09, still current. The Arizer Solo II and Solo III CPSC recalls
are modeled as `recalls/TRCL-0010` and `recalls/TRCL-0011`, with source-backed
relations to the manufacturer and Solo III device record; their Health Canada
counterparts are `recalls/TRCL-0015` and `recalls/TRCL-0016` (swept
2026-09-06, see below). The crosslink layer rejects a fully isolated satellite
collection (`CXL-13`), and the DCC generator emits conservative organization →
laboratory/recall reverse edges when unique license-number matches exist.

Device-recall coverage was extended on 2026-09-05 with `recalls/TRCL-0012`: the
2017 CPSC Firewood 4 battery-fire recall (17-761, ≈400 units) now has its own
entity linked to `devices/TED-0086` and `manufacturers/TMFR-0028`, closing the
recall-coverage gap flagged by the device-catalog adversarial review. A sweep
of the other Milestone-A manufacturers against the CPSC / SaferProducts recall
database found no additional device recalls to model: PAX, Puffco, and Dr.
Dabber each show no CPSC recall on record (the review's "PAX Era CPSC 2025"
candidate does not exist), and no other catalog manufacturer appears in the
vaporizer recall set. A June 2026 Colorado MED recall of PAX-branded vape oil
is a state cannabis-product recall in a jurisdiction the archive does not yet
model (California, Massachusetts, and Michigan only) — a candidate for the
jurisdiction-expansion lane, not the device-recall graph.

Health Canada's recall database was swept on 2026-09-06 via the Recalls and
Safety Alerts open-data feed (34,052 rows; cannabis subcategory 98; consumer
product safety 5,194; selection and counts in `datasets/TDTS-0028` and
`data/health-canada/recall-sweep.json`). Four device-relevant events are now
modeled: `recalls/TRCL-0013` (Firewood 4, 2017 — Canadian counterpart of CPSC
17-761), `recalls/TRCL-0014` (HEXO disposable cannabis vape pens, 2021 —
cannabis-product recall with a device-level hardware cause, ~100,132 units),
`recalls/TRCL-0015` (Arizer Solo II, 2025 — counterpart of the CPSC notice),
and `recalls/TRCL-0016` (Arizer Solo III, 2026 — Health Canada / CPSC joint
recall). Each Canadian notice is paired with its U.S. counterpart entity
where one exists, and all four link to the Canada jurisdiction profile
(`jurisdictions/TJUR-0057`). Grower's Edge (2020) and Wismec (2018) vaporizer
recalls surfaced in the sweep but are unmodeled manufacturers; the remaining
cannabis-subcategory records are product-scope events outside the
device-recall graph and remain a bulk-ingestion candidate for the Canada
lane. Recall coverage is now scoped CPSC / SaferProducts plus Health Canada
for the catalog's manufacturer set.

## Publication hardening update

The publication-hardening work merged, and the git-history rewrite it depended on
was executed and force-pushed on 2026-08-12T18:04:56Z. Verified 2026-08-13
against a fresh clone of `origin/main`: `.git` is 3.2 MiB, no blob exceeds
2 MiB, and `git log origin/main -- data/dcc/license-registry/latest.json`
returns no commits.

That is a statement about `origin/main` only. **The payload is still served by
GitHub** through 43 pre-rewrite `refs/pull/N/head` refs, on a public repository,
to an unauthenticated fetch. The release gate cannot see this: `LARGE-003` and
`LARGE-004` scan `git rev-list --all` in the local clone, and a CI checkout has
no `refs/pull/*`. A green gate is therefore not evidence the exposure is closed.
See docs/history-cleanup-plan.md for the remediation path. The reproduction is not
recorded in this repository; ask the maintainers.

A working clone made before the rewrite also reports `LARGE-00x` findings,
because its own stale branches and tags keep the purged payloads reachable
locally. Delete the stale refs and `git gc --prune=now` before treating one of
those as real.

The rewrite did not, by itself, unblock the release audit — that is worth stating
plainly because two earlier drafts of this file implied it did. The audit already
passed before the rewrite: the tracked payloads had been untracked in `6d740f4`,
and PR #41 graded the deleted-but-reachable history findings `medium`, below the
`high` fail threshold. CI is green on the pre-rewrite head `6e693a8` with every
blob still reachable. The rewrite removed the data; it did not change a gate
result.

On a clean clone of `39a5589` the audit reports 79 findings, 49 active — 15
`REV-001` informational, 20 `PII-005` low, 10 `PII-007` medium and 4 `PII-005`
medium. After the 2026-08-13 adjudication it reports 75 findings, 35 active — 20
`PII-005` low and 15 `REV-001` informational — with nothing at medium or above.
The mediums were suppressed with recorded rationale, not removed.

All 14 were declarations rather than data. `PII-007` is a bare substring scan
with no value allowlist, so it fired wherever the prohibited-field denylist is
defined or generated: `EXCLUDED_FIELD_NAMES` in `scripts/ingest/validation.py`,
the generated `privacy-spec.md` and `source-catalog.json`, one dated sync report
recording which fields the privacy gate blocked, and a report describing the
California fields the pipeline drops. Five exact-path suppressions cover those;
`docs/audit-config.json` was already suppressed for the same reason. The
placeholder EIN is a value-scoped entry in `allowlist.tax_ids` instead, which is
narrower than silencing a whole file.

A directory-prefix suppression form was written for the dated `sync-reports/`
directory and then removed the same day. Sync reports embed a 100-character
window of real page content around each blocked field, there is no name detector
anywhere in the audit, and the business-owner-name field has no other tripwire — so
pre-authorising every future file in that directory would have removed the only
control that could catch an owner name. Suppression is exact-match only, and
`tests/test_audit_suppressions.py` now also asserts that every shipped entry
names a real file and that no bare-code entry silences a rule able to block the
gate.

Behind the pull-ref exposure, the remaining release blockers are the licensing
and security-contact decisions, plus the 20 low `PII-005` items, which are long
numeric runs flagged for human review by design.

Validation must be rerun on the completed branch. Do not use an audit bypass as
a release result.
